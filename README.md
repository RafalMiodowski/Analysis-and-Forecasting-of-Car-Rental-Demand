# Car Rental Demand Analysis and Forecasting

## General Project Description

The project involves the analysis and forecasting of demand for cars in a rental company. The goal was to develop a predictive model that could accurately forecast future demand for cars in the rental service. All the data used in this project are fictitious and were generated under laboratory conditions. Therefore, they are not perfect and may affect some analysis results.

## Project Idea

The main goal of the project was to build a model that would predict car rental demand based on historical rental data. Such forecasts are crucial for optimizing the car fleet, minimizing costs, and improving vehicle availability for customers.
