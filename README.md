# Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Car-Rental-Demand

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the demand for car rentals using various machine learning models. The primary goal is to build predictive models that accurately estimate the rental duration and revenue based on historical data.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
   - Import and clean the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, correlations, and patterns.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implement multiple regression models to predict rental demand.
   - Use advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Develop a neural network model for further enhancement of predictive capabilities.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).
   - Compare the results of different models to identify the best-performing model.

## Key Findings

1. **Random Forest Model:**
   - MSE: 220.19
   - RMSE: 14.84
   - MAE: 9.83
   - R²: 0.9995
   - Conclusion: The Random Forest model demonstrates high effectiveness in predicting car rental revenues with minimal errors and a high R² value, indicating a good fit to the data.

2. **Gradient Boosting Model:**
   - MSE: 0.2745
   - RMSE: 0.5240
   - MAE: 0.3820
   - R²: 0.9962
   - Conclusion: The Gradient Boosting model shows very high accuracy in forecasting rental duration with low error values and a high R² value.

3. **Neural Network Model:**
   - MSE: 80.147
   - RMSE: 8.952
   - MAE: 6.943
   - R²: 0.999484
   - Conclusion: The neural network model achieves very low prediction errors and a very high R², indicating that it explains nearly all the variability in the data.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques in forecasting car rental demand. The results indicate that models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and neural networks can provide highly accurate predictions, which can be instrumental for rental companies in optimizing their operations and revenue management.
